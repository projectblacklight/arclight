## Contributing

ArcLight is a collaborative open source project where contributions are welcome. This contributing guide is borrowed in part from the [GeoBlacklight Contributing Guide](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Reporting issues

Did you find a bug in ArcLight or interested in a new feature? Please make sure to add an issue for it in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/issues) as follows:

 - Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
 - Submit a new [Github issue](https://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/issues) by:
    - Clearly describing the issue
    - Provide a descriptive summary
    - Explain the expected behavior
    - Explain the actual behavior
    - Provide steps to reproduce the actual behavior

### Contributing code or documentation

ArcLight also welcomes code and documentation contributions. We follow the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model for contributing on GitHub.

#### Pull request overview

1. Fork it ( http://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

#### Merging Changes

Here are some general rules to follow for merging pull requests.

- It is considered "poor form" to merge your own request.
- Please take the time to review the changes and get a sense of what is being changed. Things to consider:
  - Does the commit message explain what is going on?
  - Does the code changes have tests? _Not all changes need new tests, some changes are refactorings_
  - Do all new methods, modules, and classes have comments? Do changed methods, modules, and classes have comments?
  - Does the commit contain more than it should? Are two separate concerns being addressed in one commit?
  - Did the Travis tests complete successfully?
- If you are uncertain, bring other contributors into the conversation by creating a comment that includes their `@username`.
- If you like the pull request, but want others to chime in, create a +1 comment and tag a user.

If you wish to ask questions or participate further, see our general [README](https://github.com/projectblacklight/arclight/blob/main/README.md).
