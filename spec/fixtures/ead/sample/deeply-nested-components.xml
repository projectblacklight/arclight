      <p>During processing of the 2005 accession significant changes were made to the organization of the finding aid. Some new material was physically interfiled in existing series or subseries in the appropriate box. In other cases, additions to a series or subseries has been placed in a new box. This finding aid reflects the intellectual arrangement of the collection with the result that in the detailed container listing box numbers are not always consecutive.</p>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Joseph Maddy, Interlochen's founder and long-time leader, was born in Wellington, Kansas, on October 21, 1891. Both his parents were educators. His father taught before becoming a banker, and his mother served as county school superintendent. Both also enjoyed performing music, especially his mother, an accomplished amateur musician. Their first son, Harry, a year and a half older, served as a role model in Joe's early musical career.</p>
      <p> As youths, the two brothers joined the newly formed Wellington Boys Band. Its director took the group on a musical camping trip, which Joe greatly enjoyed. Later, the boys graduated to the town band. They also performed in the family quartet, which was expanded during their early teens when another talented musical family, the Petits, moved to town. The Petits' youngest daughter, Fay, who years later eventually became Mrs. Joseph Maddy, and the two families spent part of a summer playing music while camping together.</p>
      <p> On becoming president, Odell spent much of his first year meeting with Interlochen supporters both on campus and throughout the country in order to define the institution's future goals. Then, he announced a major fund-raising program to renovate facilities and increase endowment, adding that he hoped to make Interochen better known both in its home area and beyond. In fact, during Odell's tenure, the camp was named one of the top ten camps in the country and the World Youth Symphony Orchestra performed in the Cultural Olympiad at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA.</p>
      <p> Odell was succeeded by Edward J. Downing. During Downing's time in office, Interlochen merged with The Pathfinder School, a local independent day school for pre-school through eighth-grade students. Downing retired in 2002 and was succeeded by Jeffery S. Kimpton in 2003.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The records of the Interlochen Center for the Arts were received in installments over many years. They came from several sources: the Camp office in Ann Arbor, the Tremaine family, an alumni leader, and various administrators at Interlochen, but the greatest proportion was assembled from Maddy's home and Interlochen offices, after his death, by Margaret (Peg) Stace, his long-time assistant.</p>
      <p> The Camp files for 1935-1945 comprise the major portion received in their original order, and they were in disarray because of frequent changes in Camp secretaries and the practice of moving the office (along with relevant files) from Ann Arbor to Interlochen and back each summer. Also, Maddy kept many items of a personal and confidential nature at home.</p>
      <p> In processing the records, an attempt was made both to preserve the original order, where ascertainable, and to highlight major subjects and individuals, some of whose importance only became apparent with the passage of time. A separate name index is available for major correspondents. Where extant, explanatory historical and background information has been placed at the front of records categories. Because of Maddy's influence on the development of Interlochen both past and present, his correspondence with later administrators has been included if practical, under "Administration" in their papers.</p>
      <p> The surviving records have been divided into nine series: Chronological, Subject, Post-Maddy Administrators, Boards, Closed, Printed, Visual Materials, Sound Recordings, and Scrapbooks. The Chronological focuses on Maddy and the Camp until 1966 while the Subject, is composed of two subseries. The first, mainly 1928-1989, though also heavily relating to Maddy, also includes much on developments through the '90s. The second subseries, 1930-2003, Later Acquisition represents a group of files that were acquired in 2005. Many files pertain to the early camp and Joesph Maddy. The Post-Maddy Administrators series begins in the late 1950's when Maddy expanded the staff in anticipation of making Interlochen a year-round institution and continues unto the most recent accession. Boards (governing bodies) starts with the Camp's founding in 1928 and ends in 1989 while the Closed series covers the Maddy, Haas, and Wilson administrations through 1971. Printed offers coverage to the present but is more complete for the early years through the 1980's. While the Visual Materials and Sound Recordings series extend from the 1920's into the 1980's, it offers best coverage from 1924 to 1942 Scrapbooks, with gaps in the early years, documents both Maddy and the Camp, beginning with the National High School Orchestra and ending with the Camp's 50th anniversary celebration in 1978.</p>

          <p>The Chronological series emphasizes Maddy and the Camp until 1966. It is divided into several subseries: Maddy biography, Camp history, Camp files, 1935-1945, Camp files, 1945-1966, and Special correspondence. The first two subseries provide documentation for the earliest years. The series is supplemented by the Subject series which is especially useful for Camp operations and the founding of the Academy.</p>

            <p>The Subject Files series, is divided into two subseries. The first, mainly 1928-1989, emphasizes Maddy and his administration of Interlochen although later materials, especially for the decade or two following his death, are also included. It has six sub-subseries: Joseph Maddy, Giddings and Tremaine, Interlochen, Camp, Academy, and College. The Maddy sub-subseries focuses on his career activities apart from Interlochen while Giddings and Tremaine contains background information and publications of the two other early Camp leaders. Interlochen covers subjects affecting the institution in general, mainly the Camp before 1962 and both it and the Academy thereafter. The remaining sub-subseries focus on detailed planning and operation of: the National Music Camp, Interlochen Arts Academy, and proposed Interlochen College of Creative Arts.</p>

              <p>The Maddy sub-subseries contains information on his professional activities outside Interlochen. Many of them relate to his role as a faculty member of the university. Although direct ties to Interlochen are lacking, virtually everything he did somehow involved the institution he founded. The sub-subseries consists of six subsections: Appearances, Broadcasting, Civic Music, Music Education, Publications, Speeches and Writings, and University of Michigan.</p>

                <p>"Broadcasting", mainly 1931-1948, documents Maddy's non-Interlochen radio work. It includes his correspondence and scripts for instrumental and vocal education programs as well as correspondence, reports, and other records on his attempt to create an alternative to commercial radio, largely using the new FM technology. Scripts include those used by announcers Mike Wallace and Ward Quaal and texts of radio addresses on Americanism by Murray Van Wagoner, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Karl Detzer. Researchers will also want to check "Civic Music" for Maddy's wartime broadcasts and "Music Education" for the professional educators' program "Music and American Youth." Since much of his non-Interlochen broadcasting was done for the university, reports and other information about it can be found under "University of Michigan" (6) in this sub-subseries. Recordings and a movie film of his instructional programs can be found in the Visual Materials and Sound Recordings series.</p>
